code for James-Stein for the Leading Eigenvector
This is object oriented python code for producing the boxplots of Figure 3 in the article "James-Stein for the Leading Eigenvector" by L. Goldberg and A. Kercheval.

SimulationJSE.py defines the class SimulationJSE to set up the model and data.
jse-main.py is the main program that computes and displays the performance metrics from the generated data.

Code was run with Python 3.6.10 using Spyder 4.0.1.
